VERY IMPORTANT!!!!!

When testing, create .env file based on .env.example template, contact angel for client id and client secret, web app
won't run otherwise =)

ALSO, make sure to download and get redis running before trying to run app.py, how to do so can be found on "11_4 Semicolon Expected Angel Solis.pdf" under the angel solis - documentation folder

You will have to make sure redis is running prior to running app.py every every time you run app.py (only for development purposes, this will be fixed when app is deployed ^_^)

To make sure redis is running, open a command prompt, then type "redis-cli ping", if you get the response "PONG" then redis is working!
